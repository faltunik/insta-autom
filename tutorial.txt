TIPS:
1. We are using unofficial version of the Instagram Public Graphql API (to avoid getting banned, this library is purposefully slow)
2. Instagram continually makes changes in BOT Detection algorithm, so sometimes, we may get error, we can try again letter
3. Try to scrap through <25 urls in one go


How to Setup API
1. Pip install requirements.txt
2. pip install boto3 (it gives error if you install it before requirements.txt)
3. start by running following command "uvicorn main:app"
